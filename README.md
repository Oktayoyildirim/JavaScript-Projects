# JavaScript-Projects
I will push code to this repository and then provide my Instructor with the URL so they can review my code.
Here are a few small projects I created using JavaScript:

Projects:

Pizza Menu
Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Calculator


Pizza Menu: This project features an interactive menu for ordering pizza, offering a variety of toppings. It takes user input and calculates the total cost of the order.

Tic-Tac-Toe Game: A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with a twist: the first player is chosen by a dice roll. Players can select their tokens, and the game celebrates the winner with music and flashing lights.

Calculator: A simple four-function calculator that allows users to add, subtract, multiply, and divide. The design is clean and user-friendly, making basic calculations quick and easy.
